# Adelie-and-Chinstrap-Penguins
# This project focuses on Adelie and Chinstrap Penguins,as these particular species has been in decline.
In this activity, I will conduct simple linear regression on the penguins dataset (gotten from Seaborn datasets)
## Project Questions:
1. What do you observe about the different aspects of penguins shown in the data
2. What do you observe about the number of rows and columns in the data
3. Drop the rows with missing values
4. Using a scatter plot, check if the linearity assumption is met
5. Check if both flipper length and body mass are normally distributed
6. Check if the assumption of independent observations is met by considering the context of what each entry in the data represents and how it would have been collected
7. Write the linear regression formula for modeling the relationship between body mass and flipper length 
8. Implement the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) approach for linear regression
9. Create a linear regression model for the data, fit the model to the data
10. Get a summary of the results from the model
